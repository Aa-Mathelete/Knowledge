Recently, I've been playing my music and had the idea of writing down the little bits of improvisation I do when playing my flute. I noticed that there really *isn't a fast way of writing music*. Hence came the idea of making my project-Music Maker! Additionally, I am using AI to help write the code for this. Honestly speaking, I have had the idea of doing this for a  *long* time, but I never had the time (yep, that old excuse). So I decided why not cram it in with everthing else I have to do •ᴗ•. 

# Updates
Will come when I have something to report! •ᴗ•
