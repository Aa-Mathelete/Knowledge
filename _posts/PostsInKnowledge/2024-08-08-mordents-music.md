So, recently I've been playing my flute music and I found this in my music:

So... let's dive in what this is in music!

## What is a Mordent?

On the left side you can see the mordent, and the "translated preforming version". Simply put, a mordent is sort of like a lightning bolt rotated 90 degrees. A mordent is a fast alternation between two notes, the indicated note (the note the mordent is on) and the note above
Here is an exampe of how an **mordent** looks and is preformed:

## What is an Inverted Mordent?

An inverted mordent is the opposite of a mordent. It includes the same rapid alternation between two notes, but for the **inverted mordent** the notes are the one indicated and the note below. Here is a illustrated representation:

## The Variants

Ultimately, mordents and inverted mordents are symbols used in music notation. However, different variations have been derived from these original symbols.

## An Important Question
While I was learning about Mordents and Inverted Mordents I was wondering: 
*How do Mordents/Inverted Mordents compare with Trills?*

First let's compare how they look like in sheet music.

Look closely at the zig-zag for the trill. It looks similar to the one zig-zag of the mordent! Additionally, if you remember, trills are played on the indicated note and the one above it. (Don't Worry, I attached the trill diagrams below: ). Comparatively, the diffrent types of trills are like the mordents! If you don't know what Baroque trills are: "A Baroque trill often looks like the top notation but is performed as in the bottom notation. Baroque trills may also be indicated using a plus sign (+) instead of the tr notation"(Tina Christie Flute par 8). Below is a representation:
