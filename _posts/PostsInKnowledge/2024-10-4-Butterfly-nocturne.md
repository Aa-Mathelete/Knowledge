# The Epitome of The Story
5th Grade. The grade when I figured out trills. During that time, I would practice my flute whenever I had free time. One strong memory of this I fondly remember is coming inside during recess and practicing my flute, playing pieces to simply composing little melodies. During this period of time I started to develop my ambition! This nocturne pays respect from that starting point of my metamorphosis, the hard struggles, and the success along the way! 

    Thank you, and keep on challenging yourself!
