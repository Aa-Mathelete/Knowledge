Before we discuss Brainrot, I'd like to note that while it is not a clinical condition, it is an important condition to be aware of.

# What is Brainrot?
 According to the Newport Institute, "Brainrot, is a state of mental fogginess and cognitive decline that results from excessive screen engagement," (par 4). In simpler words, Brainrot (also written as Brain rot) is the effect when you consume negative content. Negative content includes/or enforces Doomscrolling, Misinformation/Fake News, Violent/Graphic Content, Social Media Comparisons, and Toxic Communities (These are just some types, of negative content). 

# Do You Have It? Symptoms of Brainrot

It's a long day after school, and you whip out your phone once you get home. You immediately go to one of the Social Media Apps on your phone and scroll for what feels like five minutes, but once you check the time, you're flabbergasted. Thirty minutes have passed.

If you're in the habit of scrolling in your idle time, you likely suffer from one or more of these symptoms: difficulty concentrating, mental fatigue, a degraded attention span, memory issues, mood swings, and a consistent overwhelmed feeling. Even suffering from one of these symptoms can cause disturbances in everyday life! For instance, if you suffer from difficulty concentrating, you would be unable to pay attention in class and as a result would struggle with completing everyday homework assignments. 

# Causes

You probably guessed it, the main cause of brain rot is rooted in Social Media Apps. Yet more specifically, short clips of content, less than sixty seconds long. Excess screen time in these short clips causes people to lose interest in something quickly--degrading their attention span. Yet the content of these short clips also can cause mental problems. For example, some of these problems include anxiety(from misinformation), and depression(from comparisons, that cause insecurities).

# Prevention/Management
There are numerous measures you can take to prevent/manage your brain's health, I listed down my favorite--a digital detox.
To start doing a digital detox, look through your social media apps and like positive content. Then start setting screen time limits and make sure they are reasonable! If your screen time is three hours don't jump to the limit of 15, go gradually, that way you are more likely to follow it! Next, follow up on activities that interest you, whether it's catching up on the latest Rick Riordan books, or playing your instrument!

1. **Set Clear Goals**: Define what you want to achieve with your detox. This could be reducing screen time, improving focus, or lowering stress levels.

2. **Limit Screen Time**: Establish specific times during the day when you will use digital devices. For example, you might decide to check your phone only during lunch breaks and after dinnerÂ¹.

3. **Curate Your Feeds**: Unfollow accounts that post negative or unproductive content. Instead, follow accounts that inspire and uplift youÂ¹.

4. **Engage in Non-Digital Activities**: Spend time on hobbies that don't involve screens, such as reading books, drawing, or exercisingÂ¹.

5. **Practice Mindfulness**: Incorporate mindfulness practices like meditation or deep breathing exercises to help reduce stress and improve mental clarityÂ¹.

6. **Prioritize Sleep**: Ensure you get enough sleep by turning off digital devices at least an hour before bedtimeÂ¹.

7. **Seek Positive Social Interactions**: Spend time with family and friends in person to strengthen your real-life connectionsÂ¹.

8. **Create Tech-Free Zones**: Designate certain areas in your home, like the dining room or bedroom, as tech-free zones to encourage more meaningful interactions and relaxationÂ¹.

9. **Use Tools to Help**: Consider using apps that limit your screen time or lock your phone during certain hours to help you stay on trackÂ².

10. **Reflect and Adjust**: Regularly assess your progress and make adjustments as needed to ensure your detox is effective and sustainableÂ².
