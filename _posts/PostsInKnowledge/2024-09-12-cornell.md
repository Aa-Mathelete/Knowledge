# Outline Method VS Cornell Notes

The Outline Method, the classic, title, to heading, to subheading, to points. You have probably used this style of notetaking, yet do you know how efficent this is compared to other, aberrant ones?

The Cornell Method of notetaking offers a organized yet simple way of notetaking. Personally, this one is my favorite, because of the easy set up! The setup looks like this:

While the Outline Method is perfect for almost everything, the Cornell Method is perfect for subjects *like english, social studies/history, health, or language classes*!
