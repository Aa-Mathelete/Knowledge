Absolute Value is the distance from zero a number has; Absoulute Value bars look like this ||.  If you have a number inside them, then that numeber, no matter if it is negative, turns positive. Here is an example:  |6| = 6,  |-6| = 6. If there is a *negative sign outside* then the result is negative. Here is what I mean:  -|300| = -300. Once you solve inside the bars, then the negative is attached.

## How to solve Absolute Value equations

To solve an absolute value equation you have to break it into 2 parts, one side equaling a negative, and other positive. Doing this gets rid of the absolute value bars.

Example 1
</div>
<div class="box-content" markdown="1">
|2x-4|=20
</div>
</div>

$$

First we will solve positive twenty, then negative twenty.
2x-4=20
 +4 on both sides
2x=20
Divide by 2 on both sides
x=10

Now let's solve for -20

$$

2x-4=-20

+4     +4 
Add 4 on both sides

2x=-16
2/2x=-16/2
Divide by 2 on both sides

x=-8
$$

Finally, we solved **both** for negative and positive our answers are: x=-8 and x=10.
