Absolute Value is the distance from zero a number has; Absoulute Value bars look like this ||.  If you have a number inside them, then that numeber, no matter if it is negative, turns positive. Here is an example:  |6| = 6,  |-6| = 6. If there is a *negative sign outside* then the result is negative. Here is what I mean:  -|300| = -300. Once you solve inside the bars, then the negative is attached.
