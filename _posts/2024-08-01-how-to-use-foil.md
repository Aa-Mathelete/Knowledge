Hi! In this post I'm going to cover: what FOIL is in math, how to apply it, some exampes, and tips! ðŸ¤“ Have fun!

## What does FOIL stand for?

Foil stands for:

 **F**irst

 **O**uter

 **I**nner

 **L**ast


Ok, so this sequence is **essential** to **multiplying binomials** correctly. Now that you know what FOIL stands for let's figure out how to use it!

## Applying FOIL

Based on the image above, you should get an idea of what applying foil looks like. 
    **First** we multiply the first two terms.  Next, we multiply the terms near the **outside** of the parathesis.Next, we multiply the two terms in the middle, or the **inside**. Finally, we multiply the **last** two terms. A trick to remember this is by thinking of multiplying binomials as a jelly filled donut. 
    Think about it!
