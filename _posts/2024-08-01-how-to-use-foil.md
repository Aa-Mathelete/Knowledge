Hi! In this post I'm going to cover: what FOIL is in math, how to apply it, some exampes, and tips! Along with teaching you how to multiply binomials, I'll teach you another way, which I like to call Double Distribution. ðŸ¤“ Have fun!

Lets first start with FOIL!
 
## What does FOIL stand for?

Foil stands for:

 **F**irst

 **O**uter

 **I**nner

 **L**ast


Ok, so this sequence is **essential** to **multiplying binomials** correctly. Now that you know what FOIL stands for let's figure out how to use it!

 Reminder: FOIL is used for multiplying binomials, not dividing, adding, or subtracting!

## Applying FOIL

Based on the image above, you should get an idea of what applying foil looks like. 
    **First** we multiply the first two terms.  Next, we multiply the terms near the **outside** of the parathesis.Next, we multiply the two terms in the middle, or the **inside**. Finally, we multiply the **last** two terms. A trick to remember this is by thinking of multiplying binomials as a jelly filled donut. For example, the jelly is the inside of the equation; then the crunchy outside would be where the paranthesis are.
    Think about it!

Reminder: When applying FOIL, everything must be done in relation to the paranthesis!

## Examples of Foil
Below, I'm going to solve some FOIL problems. I suggest you solving them first, and then check your work with mine!

## Double Distribution
Let's say, you don't like how FOIL is: it feels to "robotic" to you. There is another way to multiply binomials that ties in the distributive property-not a acronyms. I named this method Double Distribution, and it's very simple. Here is an example I used it solve a question.
