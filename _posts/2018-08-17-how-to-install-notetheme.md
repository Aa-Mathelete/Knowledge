Foil stands for:

 **F**irst

 **O**uter

 **I**nner

 **L**ast


Ok, so this sequence is **essential** to **multiplying binomials** correctly. Now that you know what FOIL stands for let's figure out how to use it!

## Applying FOIL 


1. Download and install **[Github Client](https://desktop.github.com/)** (GC). GC helps you "upload" changes from local host (on your own computer) to your remote (on Github server).
2. Login to GC with the account created in step 1.
3. Clone the repo created in step 3 of previous section to your local computer:
	1. Come back to the repo's directory, click on **Set up in Desktop**, a popup appears to ask you "*Open Github Desktop?*", choose **Open Github Desktop**
	2. This will open GC on your computer, click on button **Clone**
	3. Choose the location where you save your repo on your computer. A folder whose name is **\<your-account\>.github.io** will be created.
4. From this step, you will apply a theme [downloaded from the internet](http://jekyllthemes.org) for your Github page. In this case, you will apply **[notetheme](https://github.com/dinhanhthi/notetheme)**.
5. Download [notetheme](https://github.com/dinhanhthi/notetheme) to your local computer (a file .zip)
6. Delete all files and folders in folder **\<your-account\>.github.io** created in step 3.3.
7. Extract all files and folders from file .zip in step 5 to folder **\<your-account\>.github.io**
8. Open file **_config.yml** and change some fields in this file
	1. `title`: your website's name
	2. `description`: your website's description
	3. `baseurl`: leave blank (i.e., `""`)
	4. `url`: `<your-account>.github.io`
	5. `paginate`: number of posts on each page (default is 28)
	6. `banner`: directory to your website's banner
	7. `favicon`: directory to your website's favicon (icon appears on the left on browser's tab)
	8. `user`: change all your personal information (`name`, `email`, `website`, `avatar`,...)
	9. Save and close **_config.yml**
9. Open Github Desktop to see the changes
	1. Write something on field commit
	2. Click on **Commit to master** and then **Publish branch**
10. All done! Go to **https://\<your-account\>.github.io** to see the changes, you may wait a little minutes to get the changes.
