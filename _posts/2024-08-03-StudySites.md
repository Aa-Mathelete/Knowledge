Every Subject at school has specific sites that 
help you to study for tests, but as a student we 
have to jump around websites to figure out which 
would help with our specific needs. So I listed down 
my favorite websites for excelling at school
(Don't worry they are listed by subject:). 

## Writing/Reading/Language Arts
{% include more.html content="[Quizlet](https://quizlet.com/latest)." %}

Quizlet is *amazing* to use in academics for memorizing terms quickly. Honestly, this website has saved me in numerous subjects including math(formulas), science, languages, and more!

{% include more.html content="[Cliffnotes](https://www.cliffsnotes.com/study-guides)." %}

Cliffnotes is one of the few websites I suggest for **quick studying only**. For example, you have 10 minutes and want to review some key points. I encourage using this website for the numerous *study guides* it has.

## Launguage
To study/learn more I only use one app, Duolingo, yet for my needs it is perfect! Comment below if you know any other good websites to study!
{% include more.html content="[Duolingo](https://www.duolingo.com/)." %}

Duolingo is *great for recapping lesson material, while also learning some extra*; remember that Duolingo might not cover most of your study material. So besides using Duolingo, I like to use an online textbook **use an AI resource to summarize, and quiz me, basically like a study buddy** (who has a Neural Network brain :). 

## Science

For the Science I am learning right now (*Really* Basic stuff), I don't have to do intense studying, but when I have to study I use Quizlet, and occasionally, Khan Academy for clarification.

{% include more.html content="[Quizlet](https://quizlet.com/latest)." %}
This one is simply obvious...

{% include more.html content="[Khan Academy-Science](https://www.khanacademy.org/science)." %}


## Math

{% include more.html content="[Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/math)." %}
Khan Academy is a grade saver. With thousands of practice problems varying from grade to subject, it is the perfect tool for studying.

{% include more.html content="[Deltamath](https://www.deltamath.com/teachers-schools)." %}

When using Khan Academy, I noticed that some problems lacked difficulty, so I started also using Deltamath. My school district uses Deltamath, so I have plenty of experience using Deltamath Student. Yet, for practicing/studying I suggest using a Deltamath Teacher account(It's Free). Once you make one, you can assign yourself numerous topics ranging from **basic math to Calculus**. 



## Pdf/E-books/and more

{% include more.html content="[Internet Archive]( https://archive.org/)." %}

 I like to find my textbook online, so I can study from anywhere. I use Internet Archive[It's free]. I've used it a lot (For my Spanish Textbook, and entertainment reading) and I can confirm it is safe to use.

 {% include more.html content="[Hoopla](https://www.hoopladigital.com/)." %}

  Additionally, if you have a library card you can use it on Hoopla to *watch movies, read books, and more*! You have 8 borrows in a month and can borrow a book for 21 days.
