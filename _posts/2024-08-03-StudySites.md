Every Subject at school has specific sites that 
help you to study for tests, but as a student we 
have to jump around websites to figure out which 
would help  for our specific needs. So I listed down 
my favorite websites for exceling at school
(Don't worry they are listed by subject:).

## Writing/Reading/Language Arts
{% include more.html content="[Quizlet](https://quizlet.com/latest)." %}

Quizlet is *amazing* to use in academics for memorizing terms in a short period of time. Honestly, this website has saved me in numeros subject including math(formulas), science, launguages, and more!

{% include more.html content="[Cliffnotes](https://www.cliffsnotes.com/study-guides)." %}

Cliffnotes is one of the few websites that I suggest for **quick studying only**. For example, you have 10 minutes and want to review some key points. I encourage using this website for the numerous study guides it has.

## Launguage
## Science
## Math
